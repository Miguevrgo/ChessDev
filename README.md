# Oxide Chess Wiki

Hi everyone!

I'm **Miguevrgo**, creator of the [Oxide Chess Engine](https://github.com/miguevrgo/Oxide) (which you probably haven't heard of). This project is a personal initiative to build a modern, practical **chess programming wiki**, aimed at developers who want to create or improve their own engines.

Unlike the glorious [ChessProgrammingWiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/), this wiki focuses more on **real implementation details**, walking through **how to actually build a chess engine step by step**, from board representation to move generation, search, evaluation, and NNUE integration.

---

## ✨ Goals

- Provide a practical, modern guide for writing a chess engine.
- Cover the **most common techniques** used in current engines.
- Focus deeply on **search improvements** and **NNUE**, which I feel deserve more clarity than existing resources provide.
- Offer a **coherent path from zero to working engine** — not just a reference, but a tutorial-like journey.

---

## 🛠️ Status

This project is just getting started:

- ✅ Structure and first draft of some sections.
- 🔄 Switched recently from Docusaurus to **mdBook** (open to other formats).
- ⚠️ Many parts are still `#TODO`, content is skeletal and being expanded gradually.

---

## 🤝 Contributions & Feedback

Even though it's early-stage, **suggestions, feedback, or contributions are very welcome**. Whether you're an experienced engine dev or just learning, feel free to:

- Open issues
- Suggest structure improvements
- Point out gaps or unclear parts
- Share ideas for content or examples
