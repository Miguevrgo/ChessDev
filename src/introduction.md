# Introduction

Welcome to **ChessDev**, an open-source technical wiki dedicated to chess engine development. This resource aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible platform for learning chess programming techniques, serving both beginners and experienced developers looking to enhance their own engines, such as **Oxide**.

## Acknowledgments

The creation of this wiki owes much to the following resources and communities:

- **[ChessProgramming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/)**: A foundational source of knowledge during the development of Oxide. While its depth on individual topics may vary, it has been an invaluable reference for many, including myself, on this journey.
- **[Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague)**: His insightful and engaging video tutorials have brilliantly elucidated key chess programming concepts, making complex topics approachable and entertaining.
- **Open-Source Chess Engines**: Projects like Stockfish, Carp, Akimbo, Berserk, and others have generously shared their code, offering real-world examples of advanced techniques that inspire and guide the community.

## Purpose and Scope

ChessDev seeks to build upon these resources by providing detailed documentation, code examples, and practical guides tailored to the development of **Oxide** and similar engines.

## Collaboration

ChessDev is a non-profit, freely accessible resource hosted on GitHub, committed to remaining open and available to all. Contributions are warmly encouraged, whether itâ€™s correcting existing content, adding new topics, translating the wiki, or providing code examples in other programming languages (e.g., beyond Rust/C++). Together, we can create a supportive community, guiding newcomers along a rewarding path in chess programming. Join us by forking the repository at [https://github.com/Miguevrgo/ChessDev](https://github.com/Miguevrgo/ChessDev) and submitting pull requests!
